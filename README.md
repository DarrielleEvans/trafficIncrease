# Application Traffic Increase

## Purpose
The URL Shortener Application has become very popular recently. The URL Shortener is growing in demand and you must ensure at least 14,000 users can access the application at any moment.
The QA engineer will send 14,000 requests to the server. After the QA engineer tested the application, they found that 8 people were unable to access the application. As the devops engineer,
it's my responsibility to deploy a new version of the application that ensures 14,000 people at a minimum can access the application at one time.
